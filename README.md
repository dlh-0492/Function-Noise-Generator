# Function-Noise-Generator
A basic HTML-based function &amp; noise generator. Generates sine, triangle, square, and saw waveforms at frequencies 1 Hz and higher until limited by the sample rate of the device. 

The noise generator generates white, pink, and Brownian noise. The white noise generator allows users to choose between random (-1 to 1), binary (-1 or 1), and tri-state (-1, 0, or 1) values to simulate a low peak-to-RMS ratio. Pink noise and Brownian noise generators also come with clipping, also to simulate high peak-to-RMS ratios.
